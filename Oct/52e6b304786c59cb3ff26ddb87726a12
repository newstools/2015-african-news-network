One hundred pupils from across the Free State and Northern Cape said the air force is holding a possible future for them after they have experienced how it works.The pupils had spent the past week receiving basic training at the Bloemspruit air base near Bloemfontein and were awarded certificates after completing the programme on Friday.Most of them said they will be back to join the air force.Keletso Frans, 14, from Qibing Secondary School in Wepener said she would like to join the air force after completing her Grade 12. I thought a soldier s duty was only to kill people during a war, but I was wrong. There are many opportunities in the air force and you can be anything you want to be, Frans said.She said what she liked is the discipline and order that she experienced. Everything is working and on time and you must always be on time and respect always comes first, Frans said.Berne de Bruin, 14, from Dr Block High School in Heidedal near Bloemfontein, said she enjoyed the training and was also impressed with the importance of being on time. Everything is on time here and there is no such thing than better late than never . I am going to pass this important message on to my colleagues, De Bruin said.Speaking during the parade by pupils wearing orange uniforms, the chief of air staff: corporate services, Maj-Gen Sipho Mashobane, said the programme is called Falcons.The Young Falcons programme is the initiative of the South African air force as part of the Aviation Awareness drive to reach and introduce the youth of today to the cream of crop. These young people are the successors of our respectable vocation to the military aviation fraternity, Mashobane said.He said the programme was intended to achieve at least four outcomes for the Young Falcons. Developing character, pride and accountability though setting goals and experience success; developing self worth by understanding the importance of the role they play and what they have to offer; developing a sense of belonging and speak to the fact that emotional and physical safety improves participation and learning ability and improving relationships between adults and peers which amounts in developing trust and respect, Mashobane said. The Young Falcons were exposed to many aspects of aviation through various visits and lectures that enabled them to appreciate the world of aviation and what it entails. To name but a few, virtual aviation, navigation, meteorology, radiotelephony, aerodynamics and propulsion system, Mashobane said.He said he believed that pupils learned a lot and that the exposure they received would impact positively on their line of study especially their academic subjects choices.Sabata Tlatsa, head officer in the office of MEC Tate Makgoe, said they are satisfied working with the air force in shaping the future leaders of this country.Becker Semela
