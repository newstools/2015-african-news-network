David MolusiThe Sol Plaatje municipality announced the launch of an illegal dumping awareness campaign this month.The aim of the campaign is to reduce and ultimately eradicate random littering and illegal dumping, to inform, educate and create awareness among residents and businesses that the act of littering is unlawful, to solicit the support of Kimberley citizens in the prevention of littering and illegal dumping and to increase the number of residents taking responsibility for their communities.The municipality battles daily keep up with countless complaints over illegal dumps.Each month the council attends to numerous illegally dumped materials from open spaces.The community and the business community alike have been responsible for the creation and growth of these dumps.Recent remarks by high-profile visitors to Kimberley indicated the negative impact that illegal dumping had on the perception of Kimberley as a dirty city.This despite the fact that the Sol Plaatje Municipality has been spending millions of rand every year on hiring machinery and trucks to clear illegal dumps.A number of skips (refuse removal containers) have been placed at strategic areas in the city. This was met with some improvement in certain areas. However, due to the limited number of these skips, they could not keep up with the number of illegal dumps.Residents who dump their waste, forget that their own children play at these dump sites, that are infested with all kinds of health hazards and sharp objects which are harmful to the physical and psychological well-being of a children.Illegal dumps threaten human health as well as the environment.Through on-going surveys, a number of dump sites were identified in and around the city and if allowed to remain, these dumps will grow larger and attract more dumping by others.Open dumps not only create a public nuisance by making the surrounding environment unattractive, they also pose a number of health, economic, safety and environmental threats which include flooding.When it rains, illegally dumped rubbish can impact on proper drainage of water, making areas more susceptible to flooding when wastes block the drainage system.Illegal dumping can pose serious health risks and in some cases can be fatal.The most recent case of such a fatality was in Cape Town where a three-year-old died after playing on illegally dumped chemical waste.Children, while playing in these dumps, can accidentally cut or prick themselves with nails, sharp edges and syringes and as a result possibly infect themselves withdisease.Diabetic patients are requested to go to the nearest clinic and ask for containers where they can dispose of their used syringes. Once full the containers can be exchanged at the clinics for new ones.Rodents, insects and other vermin flourish in illegal dumps and may also pose health risks as they provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes which carry diseases.In 2014 it was reported that a rat in Alexandra, Gauteng had bitten off three fingers and part of a baby s nose. These rats emanated from the dumps being present.A disease known as liprositosis can also be contracted through contact with water or eating food contaminated with urine of infected rats.The city has not had any fatalities reported as yet, or rats attacking residents, but if this dumping trend should continue,it is likely to be faced with problems like these or worse.When illegal dumping takes place, the aesthetic value of local communities is diminished, often resulting in reduced property prices and loss of community pride.Illegal dumps also increases criminal activity as the dump areas are often used as hide out spots.The launching of the extensive campaign is thus to encourage the practice of a litter free environment.The administration is now shifting its focus from being reactive to the problem, to being more proactive.If everyone handled their waste properly, this funding could be better spent on service delivery projects and on improving the lives of residents in many other ways.The mayor appealed to the community to take pride in their public open spaces and the environment and take responsibility by assisting the municipality in curbing littering and illegal dumping.At the moment incidents of illegal dumping are under-reported and communities are encouraged to work with the council to ensure more incidents are reported.Residents can contact the environmental health unit on 0538306251 to report illegal dumping.
